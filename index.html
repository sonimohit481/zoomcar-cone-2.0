          <h6>SELF DRIVE CAR RENTALS IN BANGALORE</h6>
          <p>
            Bangalore is a burgeoning cosmopolitan city with a young urban
            population. Besides the all-inclusive feel, the city is witnessing a
            shifting culture that calls for an equal focus on work and leisure.
            Almost every work day ends in a relaxing meal with friends, and
            frequent road trips are the norm. With youngsters increasingly
            viewing driving as a pleasure rather than a chore, self drive car
            rentals have emerged as the answer to a prayer.
